<p>Hello, this site is a website where I will be archiving mostly Nintendo Browser based pages ect.
<br>
This site is simple for now but will become better in the future</p>

<a href="./wiiu/image-share/">The Wii U Image Share site. Sharing buttons do not work. But the links at bottom do work (except the "About This Tool" link). Also has correct working font.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a href="./wiiu/start-guide/">The Wii U Start Guide page, Broken will fix later. Looks good on Wii U browser but doesn't function correctly.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a href="./3ds/bookmarks-2015">The 3DS Bookmarks page, working except locked to left side for now. Works fine on 3ds systems</a>
